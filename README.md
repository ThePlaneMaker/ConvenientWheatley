# ConvenientWheatley
*Convenient in 2021 before Wheatley was implemented directly into The Ringing Room.
Had this code to bring Wheatley into the ringing room so that I could control him from the chat panel and tell jokes so that people wouldn't get bored while ringing.

Wheatley was made by Ben White-Horne and Matthew Johnson who are actually coding people.
I got almost no clue how to code lol. I had to ask Ben for a little help with the code, he was back then doing CompSci at Oxford so obviously he knew what he was doing.
